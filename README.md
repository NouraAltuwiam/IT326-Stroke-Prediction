# IT326-Stroke-Prediction
Data Mining Project - Stroke Prediction
---------------------------------------------
Description:
In this data mining project, we aim to predict whether a person is likely to have a stroke or not based on the information provided in the dataset. Using data mining techniques such as classification and clustering,The problem we aim to address is identifying key factors related to stroke risk in order to better understand and organize the data.
--------------------------------------------
Motivation:
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for about 11% of all deaths. This fact motivated us to choose the stroke prediction dataset, as strokes are a serious global health issue. Our team considered this topic both important and interesting, making it a meaningful and engaging case study for our data mining project.
