# IT326-Stroke-Prediction
Data Mining Project - Stroke Prediction
---------------------------------------------
Description:
In this data mining project, We want to predict whether a patient is likely to experience a stroke based on health-related attributes such as age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status.

In our project we will use two data mining tasks wich is classification , where the target variable is the stroke attribute (binary: 0 = no stroke, 1 = stroke). The classification model will be trained to be able to classify between patients who are at risk of stroke and those who are not, using the mentioned attributes as predictive features.

In addition, the dataset will also be used for a clustering task, where patients are grouped into clusters based on similar health characteristics (e.g., age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, and BMI). These clusters will help discover hidden patterns and can be further utilized to improve prediction and provide insights into patient health profiles.
--------------------------------------------
Motivation:
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for about 11% of all deaths. This fact motivated us to choose the stroke prediction dataset, as strokes are a serious global health issue. Our team considered this topic both important and interesting, making it a meaningful and engaging case study for our data mining project.
